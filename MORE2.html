          <h1>  <b> Jeep® Wrangler 4xe Named Best 4x4 in 2022  <br>   Women’s World Car of the Year awards </b> </h1>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h5>The innovative Jeep® Wrangler 4xe plug-in hybrid is the Best 4x4, according to the 2022 Women’s World Car of the Year (WWCOTY) jury, a panel of 56 motoring journalists from 40 countries spanning five continents <br> <br>

            "With the Wrangler 4xe, the Jeep brand has taken a giant step forward in many ways, but the most important is its commitment to a more sustainable environment,” said Marta García, Executive President, of WWCOTY. “It is very much appreciated that one of the true SUVs left on the market has opted for hybridization. The Jeep Wrangler 4xe's commitment to the environment is of decisive value for the Women's World Car of the Year.” <br> 
            <br>
            
            The Jeep Wrangler 4xe delivers 21 miles of zero-emission, electric-only propulsion, making it commuter friendly as an all-electric daily driver without range anxiety. It is also the most capable and eco-friendly off-road Jeep vehicle, delivering nearly silent off-roading combined with the open-air freedom that only Jeep Wrangler offers. <br> <br>

            Women's World Car of the Year is the only car awards group in the world comprised exclusively of women motoring journalists. It was created by New Zealand motoring journalist, Sandy Myhre, in 2009. She is currently Honorary President while Marta García performs as Executive President. The objective of the awards is to highlight the role of woman in the car world and also to choose the best cars of the year.</h5>
